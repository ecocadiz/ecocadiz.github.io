    <p class="w3-opacity"><i> Japanese incarceration During WWII : Lasting Effects</i></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;" class="w3-justify"> Only a few short months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941, 
      President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order uprooting the lives of over 120,000 people of Japanese descent, 
      most of whom were born and raised in the United States. Executive order 9066 authorized the U.S. military to forcibly relocate 
      Japanese immigrants and their children residing on the west coast, into internment camps under the guise of protecting 
      “national security”. Despite this act being unprecedented, it did not come as a surprise. This act was informed by several decades of 
      anti-Japanese sentiment and exclusionary laws that had only been amplified by wartime hysteria. Japanese Internment, while primarily meant 
      to rid the west coast of suspicious enemy espionage, was also a colonial project sought to assimilate Japanese into American society. 
      Camps would feature independent schools, newspapers, hospitals, youth groups, libraries, and more in hopes of one day integrating them as Americans. 
      Ironically, internment camps were constructed to replicate an ideal democratic society, despite completely limiting the freedoms of an entire ethnic population. 
      Within the camps, Japanese-Americans faced unsanitary conditions, limited privacy, poor housing, inadequate healthcare, among many other hardships. After the war,
      many of the once thriving Japanese communities struggled to reintegrate into society having lost their businesses, farms, and accrued generational wealth. It wouldn't 
      be until four decades later that the incarceration of Japanese-Americans was formally recognized by the government as a dire wartime mistake. 
      My project aims to show a part of the Japanese internment story, specifically to highlight where andwhen these populations were mobilized, 
      and show how those interned faced long-lasting setbacks upon their reintegration into society after the war. I have found that Asian-American history 
      has been so often overlooked, or outright excluded from U.S. school curriculums. My hope is that in the near future more efforts can be made to integrate 
      Asian-American history into  standardized curriculums. While my project has the goal of providing a general understanding of what happened to Japanese-Americans during the war, 
      it hardly scratches the surface of the United States long standing history with Asian-American discrimination and exclusion. I used a combination of the following four datasets to create my visualizations:
      <b>CampPopulationsByMonth.csv, JapaneseAmericanPopulation_1940_1945.csv, BehindBarbedWire_StoryMap_Data.csv, and Wra-master.csv.</b>  
      </p>
      <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px" id="band">
        <h2 class="w3-wide"> Data Visual 1: Relocation by Gender and Original State</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;" class="w3-justify"> 	This visualization was made using the Wra-master.csv. Within this csv file, is an official WRA dataset from Densho Repository, designed as a 
          census of the inmates as they entered the ten main WRA camps in 1942-1943. It contains information about each individual, including birthdate, original address, education, occupation and 
          citizenship status. Due to this CSV file being so massive, I had to subset the data to use only three columns, gender, original state, and relocation center. Moreover, the original CSV file
          contains twenty-six states that I subsetted to include data from only California, Washington and Hawaii. 
          I chose these three states because they contained the largest number of individuals that were relocated from that original location. This visualization traces the physical trajectory of 
          Japanese and Japanese-American populations that were incarcerated during WWII. Of the 107,200 individuals captured in this visualization, 48,838 were women and 58,362 were men, with the vast majority 
          (approx. 84%) originating from California. This visualization most effectively captures the massive displacement of individuals, who came primarily from the West coast, to isolated sectors across 
          the United States. The largest interment locations in this dataset were Poston in Arizona and Tule Lake in California. This is consistent with historical accounts as Poston Internment camp was the largest of 
          the ten internment camps, spanning over 71,000 acres of dry, desolate land. It was large enough that it could be divided into three distinct camps, each of which separated by one another by approximately three miles. 
          Moreover, Tule Lake was uniquely converted into a high-security segregation center for those Japanese internees that were deemed “disloyal” to the United States. As the war progressed, Tule Lake Internment camp
          maximum population exceeded that of Poston.

        <h2 class="w3-wide"> Data Visual 2 & 3: Internment Location and Population Trends</h2>
        <p class="w3-justify">The map visual contains the locations of the ten most notable internment camps, 
          highlighting large geographical distances from the west coast. These internment camps were strategically placed in 
          desert-like locations that were both easy to monitor and that would deter individuals from leaving. Within the tooltip of each
          person represented on the map contains the most valuable figure of maximum population size. Similar to the previous visualization,
          the population size for Tule Luke and Poston represent the largest amongst the ten internment camps. However, other camps such as Gila River, 
          Heart Mountain, and Manzanar reached a max population size ranging from 10,000 to over 13,000 individuals at one time. The smallest population of 
          incarcerated individuals were located in Jerome and Rohewer in Arkansas, reaching a little over 8,000. To accompany this figure, I created a time series 
          graph that you can track changes in individual camp populations by month from their opening to closing. Most of the graphs follow a similar pattern where 
          they reach a population peak in the years 1942 and 1943, maintaining these figures until 1945 when they begin to level off. One of the more notably different 
          graphs is Jerome Internment camp. Jerome didn't receive its first influx of internees until late November 1942, and only two years later during middle of the year in 1944, 
          would the population drop down to virtually nothing. This particular graph displays that Jerome was the last one of the internment camps 
          to open as well as the first to close.

  <h2 class="w3-wide"> Data Visual 4: Percent Returned to the West Coast</h2>
  <p class="w3-justify"> 	This final visualization was created using the dataset JapaneseAmericanPopulation_1940_1945.csv
     which has the number of evacuees known to have returned to west coast states compared with 1940 population of Japanese descent by county, and post office address: California, Washington and Oregon.
      This visual contains a choropleth map that compares Japanese-American population in west coast counties from 1940 to 1945. The stepped colors corresponding to the percent returned variable, emphasizes
       return lower percentages with dark blue and the lighter blue colors correspond with the greater percentages. I made this intentional color choice because I wanted the sheer impact of this forced 
       displacement to stand out on the map. A vast majority of countries on the west coast demonstrated a very low return rate of Japanese Americans after internment with the majority of Japanese-American 
       populations returning to California's Central valley. On the map, Central valley counties, Frenso  and Madera had the highest return rate at 91%-97%. 
       Many Japanese-Americans from Fresno and Madera, having gone to Manzanar internment Camp, ended up returning to their hometown. Others who were displaced much further away in other states, were much less likely to return.

  <h2 class="w3-wide"> Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="w3-justify"> 
    There is no monolithic summary that can properly account for each lived experience of the 120,000 Japanese individuals during incarceration. 
    Each of these visualizations work together to create the larger picture of the scale of which this system of exclusion operated on, 
    but doesn’t fully grapple with the stories of those who endured it. Though internment had profound and lasting effects on Japanese communities, 
    many have strived to keep this memory alive. In doing so, Japanese and Japanese-Americans have stronger ability to speak out when other minority 
    groups are unfairly targeted by their race, ethnicity, or other hyphenated identities.
